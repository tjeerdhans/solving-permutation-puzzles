# Hitting the ground running
This appendix is for the impatient. If you are interested in solving permutation
puzzles quickly, read on.

## Software
We are going to use the [GAP][gap] computer algebra system. Make sure you
install the latest version from http://www.gap-system.org/.

## Puzzle
We will look at the symmetries of the pentagon, and how to reach a certain
configuration by rotating and flipping over.

## Finding generators
Number the vertices of the pentagon 1 through 5. If we rotate it notice that it
produces the permutation

```plain
[
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  2, 3, 4, 5, 1
]
```

or `(1 2 3 4 5)` for short. Flipping the pentagon over corresponds with the
permutation

```plain
[
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  1, 5, 4, 3, 2
]
```

or `(2 5)(3 4)`

## Creating the group
Start `gap` and enter the following command to create the pentagon group.

```plain
pentagon := Group((1,2,3,4,5), (2,5)(3,4));
```

## Membership
We can use the group to check if a permutation is a member of the group; i.e. to
see that `(1 2)` is not a member of the group.

```plain
(1, 2) in pentagon;
```

Check that `(1, 5)(2, 4)` is a member.

## Solving
To solve the puzzle we want to find a word in the generators that is the
permutation.

We can do that by creating the free group, find a homomorphism and inspecting a
preimage.

```plain
f := FreeGroup("r", "s");
hom := GroupHomomorphismByImages(f, pentagon, GeneratorsOfGroup(f),
GeneratorsOfGroup(pentagon));
PreImagesRepresentative(hom, (1, 5)(2, 4));
```
