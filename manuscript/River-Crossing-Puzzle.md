# Wolf, Sheep and Cabbage Puzzle

The following cute puzzle is an example of a
[river crossing puzzle][wikipedia:river-crossing-puzzle] and involves a
ferryman, a wolf, a sheep and a cabbage. Even though this is not a permutation
puzzle we can learn a lot from it.

A ferryman finds herself on one bank of a river and is tasked with carrying the
following over the river to the other side: a wolf, a sheep and a cabbage. The
ferryman can only take one of them besides herself in the boat. If the wolf is
left alone with the sheep, the sheep will be eaten. This is something that
should be avoided. The sheep can not resist itself if left alone with the
cabbage, and will eat it if it gets the chance. This is also something that
should be avoided.

In the above puzzle the following questions arise. Is the ferryman able to ferry
the wolf, the sheep and the cabbage to the other river bank? If so, how should
the ferryman execute the ferries to complete the task?
